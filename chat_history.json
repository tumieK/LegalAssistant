This typically occurs when a tenant fails to comply with the terms of their lease agreement, such as not paying rent, violating property rules, or causing damage. The eviction process usually involves a court proceeding where the landlord must provide evidence to justify the eviction, and the tenant has the opportunity to defend themselves. If the court rules in favor of the landlord, a judgment is issued, allowing the landlord to regain possession of the property."
